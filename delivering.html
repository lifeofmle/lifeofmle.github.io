We thought the best way to do this was to just show the initial address along with the new address entry so that CS reps could check the differences</p> </div> <img src="assets/images/delivering/initialmap.png" alt="Initial design"> <p class="centred caption">Initial change address design</p> <div class="words"> <p>We went out to the customer service centre after designing a this design and to get more insights on how they handled service calls. </p> <p>When we observed the CS reps, we noticed that when fielding calls about address change, they had Google maps opened in addition to the admin interface. What we learnt from this experience were the following things: </p> <ul> <li>CS reps didn't live in the cities of the customer so they had little context of the location</li> <li>Google maps helped them orient the CS reps while the customer stated the new address</li> <li>CS reps had to copy the address back into the admin tool</li> </ul> <p>We applied these new lessons into an updated design which integrated an interactive Google maps and Google address lookup to remove the need to have an extra maps tab open.</p> </div> <img src="assets/images/delivering/improvedmap.png" alt="Updated design of address change"> <p class="centred caption">Updated change address design</p> <div class="words"> <h2>The Outcome</h2> <p> The change in design reflected actual user experiences and when updated designs were tested with the CS reps, it was well received as a potential process improvement due to the elimination of context switching while on call with customers. </p> <p> The moral of the story is that you should always try to test your prototypes in the context of the users. </p> </div> <div class="words"> <h2>Discover more</h2> </div> <div class="articles"> <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="ease-out-quad"> <a class="dark" href="https://uxdesign.cc/asking-the-better-questions-f9a43b72c1a9" target="_blank"> <div> <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0oXSzx7vCxwONZdwNU33HQ.png" width="100%"> <h2>Asking better questions</h2> </div> </a> </div> <div class="card" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="ease-out-quad"> <a class="dark" href="https://medium.com/@Lifeofmle/deciding-on-features-c8d83e31db6e" target="_blank"> <div> <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*bHOkZKf2a57v_YKOMQegaw.png" width="100%"> <h2>Deciding on features</h2> </div> </a> </div> <div class="card next" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-easing="ease-out-quad"> <a class="dark" href="./kounta.html"> <div> <div class="titleArea"> <h4>Next case study</h4><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i> </div> <h2>Unifying brand and product</h2> </div> </a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <footer> <img class="logo" src="assets/images/logo/Icon-57x57.png" alt="Michael Le"> </footer> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.3.min.js" integrity="sha256-a23g1Nt4dtEYOj7bR+vTu7+T8VP13humZFBJNIYoEJo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script>var menuBtn=$(".navbar-toggle");menuBtn.click(function(n){$(".navbar-menu").slideToggle()})</script> </body> </html>
