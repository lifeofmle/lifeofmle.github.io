I applied this learning throughout my career as an UI developer in investment banking. In the last couple of years, I realised that I really enjoyed the process of finding out the "why" in business problems. This was my motivation to become a better designer.</p> <p class="lead">I am always looking for opportunities to help people interact with technology better. For a few months I volunteered in an after school activity to teach kids ages 9-11 how to code as part of the <a class="dark" href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/" target="_blank">Code Club</a> program.</p> <p class="lead">I write and speak on topics relating to design. Here is a sample collection:</p> <ul> <li><a class="dark" href="https://medium.com/@Lifeofmle/my-portfolio-is-part-of-may1reboot-2016-fe64ab5a6a3b#.5audajwk7">Optimising the code for my portfolio</a></li> <li><a class="dark" href="https://medium.com/@Lifeofmle/what-is-good-design-5e1e9a5c38d0#.zhcxz6mtk" target="_blank">What is good design?</a></li> <li><a class="dark" href="https://medium.com/@Lifeofmle/do-ux-designers-exist-f13b42fda345#.e7ti9s30v" target="_blank">Do UX designers exists?</a></li> <li><a class="dark" href="http://www.slideshare.net/lifeofmle/exploring-design-with-agile" target="_blank">Exploring design with Agile</a> - Slides</li> </ul> <p class="lead">Design thinking is the process to find solutions</p> <p>Although I am an UX designer Omnigraffle and Axure are not the only tools I use. I am always armed with markers and post-it notes for workshops and meetings. I love using Sketch for visual designs. I enjoy paper sketching and Balsamiq for low fidelity concepts. Omnigraffle and Indigo are my tools of choice for wireframing. When it comes to prototyping I like to use the best tool for the job; Axure for simple interactions, Pixate for complex concepts and native code for higher fidelity. I am able to code for the web, Android, and C#/WPF.</p> <p>Below is a collection of my work which uses these tools alongside my design process.</p> </div> </section> <section id="portfolio"> <div class="portfolio-intro"> <div class="content"> <h1>My Work</h1> </div> </div> <div class="project kounta"> <div class="content alternate"> <div class="project-image"> <img src="assets/images/kounta/kountaipad.png" alt="Kounta iPad"> </div> <div class="project-info"> <h2>Design for the masses</h2> <p class="lead">Redesigning the Telegraph website</p> <p>I am currently working on redesigning The Telegraph website.

Simplifying and restructuring data so that all investors can understand was a common challenge.</p> <button>Read More</button> <div class="details"> <hr> <h3>The Challenge</h3> <p>There are 23 million do-it-yourself (DIY) investors in the UK and a common tool they use to monitor their investments is the portfolio report. These are often static paper or pdf reports, or webpages behind a user log-in, linked to via a monthly, quarterly or annual email or letter.</p> <p>However with all the numbers and charts, these reports are presented in a manner that requires a lot of prior financial knowledge. We wanted to know if the portfolio reports actually provide enough information to help advise investors, support their research requirements and answer questions that a DIY investor may have.</p> <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/Portfolio-Flow.png"> <h3>The Solution</h3> <p>I conducted research by interviewing retail investors and doing a competitor analysis of report providers. From interviewing the investors we found out what questions they still had outstanding. We linked the different screens together to see where the pain points were and what could be consolidated.</p> <img class="img-responsive" src="assets/images/Concepting.jpg"> <p><br>Based on our findings, we validated our concepts by using paper prototyping with our retail investors.</p> <h3>The Result</h3> <p>The research and findings of the motivation of this assignment was published as a blog article. The prototype of a potential solution was built using Pixate. You can check out both from the links below.</p> <p> <a href="http://blog.tobiasandtobias.com/post/101248009900/what-diy-investors-want-to-know" target="_blank"> <button class="btn-portfolio">Read the article</button> </a> </p> <p> <a href="http://bit.ly/InvestmentApp" target="_blank"> <button class="btn-portfolio">View the Demo</button> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="portfolio-intro"> <div class="content"> <h1>Some extra bits</h1> </div> </div> </section> <section id="background"> <div class="content"> <p class="lead">Dribbble and Navibaby</p> </div> </section> <section id="contact"> <div class="content"> <h1>Get in touch</h1> <p class="lead">Feel free to say hi or follow me online.</p> <ul class="social-links"> <li><a href="mailto:le.michael@gmail.com" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-envelope fa-fw"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/lifeofmle/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin fa-fw"></i></a></li> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/lifeofmle" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-fw"></i></a></li> </ul> </div> </section> <footer> <img class="logo" src="assets/images/logo/Icon-57x57.png" alt="Michael Le"> </footer> <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400|Playfair+Display" rel="stylesheet"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css"> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.3.min.js" integrity="sha256-a23g1Nt4dtEYOj7bR+vTu7+T8VP13humZFBJNIYoEJo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script>var investmentBtn=$(".project.investment button"),bankingBtn=$(".project.banking button"),pandapayBtn=$(".project.pandapay button"),drinksyBtn=$(".project.drinksy button"),conceptBtn=$(".project.concept button"),menuBtn=$(".navbar-toggle");investmentBtn.click(function(n){$(".project.investment .details").slideToggle()}),bankingBtn.click(function(n){$(".project.banking .details").slideToggle()}),pandapayBtn.click(function(n){$(".project.pandapay .details").slideToggle()}),drinksyBtn.click(function(n){$(".project.drinksy .details").slideToggle()}),conceptBtn.click(function(n){$(".project.concept .details").slideToggle()}),menuBtn.click(function(n){$(".navbar-menu").slideToggle()}),$(document).ready(function(){$(document).on("scroll",onScroll),$('a[href^="#"]').on("click",function(n){n.preventDefault(),$(document).off("scroll"),$("a").each(function(){$(this).removeClass("active")}),$(this).addClass("active");var t=this.hash;$target=$(t),$("html, body").stop().animate({scrollTop:$target.offset().top-50},500,"swing",function(){window.location.hash=t})})})</script> </body></html>
